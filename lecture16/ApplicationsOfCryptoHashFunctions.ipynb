    "\n",
    "Below, we'll see how bitcoin works (special case of block chain) with one of the aspects of this being that \"miners\" try to add to strings something called a \"nonce\" to get their hashes to look a certain way. This is meant to be a hard problem because we want to ensure that multiple miners tend not to find solutions at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So imagine you have to add some bytes to a string to get the hash to have some special properties - say make the first ten hexadecimal digits be zero. How hard is this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the complexity of the problem, assuming the digest were truly random, the bytes of a digest would behave like iid random bytes with all $2^8=256$ possibilities for each 8-bit byte beinq equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we can't use the structure of the hash function in any meaningful way, we only have the brute force of random guessing approach at our disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we start with a byte array add a random byte array to it, until we get some pre-determined number of zeros in its hash, on average how many trials should it take?"

    "Asymmetric crytography is based on public and private keys. Putting aside the technical details, the basic idea is this. You have a private key that you don't share with others, and a public key that you do share. The public key can be used to encrypt a file which only the private key can decrypt. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I want to send a message to you, I need your public key. I use your public key to encrypt the message, and since you are the only one holding your  private key, only you can decrypt it. \n",

    "So we are talking about a pair of functions that can be applied to a message:\n",
    "\n",
    "> pr(message) = a function only available to you\n",
    "\n",
    "> pu(message) = a function you are willing to share with others\n",

    "One model (RSA) for this is that you, the holder of a private key, pick a number pq that is a product of two prime numbers p and q. To encrypt using your public key only requires knowledge of pq, and the descryption algorithm requires knowledge of p and q. Thus, unless an attacker has an efficient way of factoring large numbers, encrypted messages are safe from decryption.\n",
